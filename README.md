# Password Strength Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the strength of passwords based on their characteristics, such as length, presence of capital letters, small letters, special characters, and numerics. Two algorithms, MLPClassifier and Logistic Regression, are utilized for accurate classification.

## Key Features
- Analyzes password characteristics to determine strength levels.
- Utilizes MLPClassifier and Logistic Regression algorithms for classification.
- Demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing and classification modeling techniques.
